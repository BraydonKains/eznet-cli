# eznetstat: A command line application with netstat shortcuts

Have you ever needed to remember how to check what process is on a port and forgotten how to do it? There are loads of netstat commands that can be tricky to remember. This is a work in progress command line application to give direct shortcuts to those netstat operations.

## Options

### -v, --version
Show application version.

### -h, --help
Show help menu.

### -c PORT, --check-port=PORT
Get the name and process ID of the process running on a given port

## TODO
* Add the ability to kill process on port
* Come up with other useful stuff
* Write up contributors guide
* Decide how to do documentation (probably Github wiki?)
* Write man page (figure out how to do that lol)
* Set up CI (probably Travis)
* Figure out distribution/release

## Contributing
I don't know that I'm ready for contributors yet because I don't have a good contributors guide. I do plan to eventually open this up to contributors. If you have any ideas for future operations, please feel free to open an issue, I am happy to discuss ideas!
